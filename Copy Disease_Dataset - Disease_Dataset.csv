Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can help relieve painful symptoms such as a sore throat.
If treating your children with painkillers, it's important to use the correct type and dosage. Younger children only need small dosages. Your pharmacist can advise you about this.
Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin.
Over-the-counter treatments that can soothe a sore throat, such as lozenges and oral sprays, are also available. Some people find that gargling with a mild antiseptic solution can also relieve a sore throat.

- For early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.
- Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you – this involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole
- If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.
- If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can't be restored – it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture, bridge or implant."

There are seven main risk factors for developing a cardiovascular disease. These are:
- age
- high blood pressure
- smoking (or a previous history of smoking)
- obesity
- lack of exercise
- having a high level of cholesterol in your blood
- having a family history of cardiovascular disease (conditions of the heart or blood vessels).
If your blood pressure is slightly higher than the ideal level (120/80mmHg), and your GP feels that the risks of cardiovascular disease are low, then you should be able to lower your blood pressure by making simple lifestyle changes.
If your blood pressure is moderately high (140/90mmHg or higher), or your GP feels that your risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years is more than one in five, then you will be advised about changing your lifestyle and may also be prescribed medication.
If your blood pressure is very high (180/110 mmHg or above) you should be referred to a hypertension specialist"

Treatment usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. It's usually taken in tablet form two or three times a day.
In most cases, a medication called hydrocortisone is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used. 
Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so you must:
- remember to collect your repeat prescriptions
- keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you
- take your medication every day at the right time
- pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below)
- carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary.
Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you're unsure."

This can include bed rest in hospital, painkillers, breathing support and regular stretches or exercises to prevent problems with the muscles and joints.
If you're left with long-term problems as a result of a polio infection, you'll probably need ongoing treatment and support.
This may include physiotherapy to help with any movement problems, devices such as splints and braces to support weak limbs or joints, occupational therapy to help you adapt to any difficulties, and possibly surgery to correct any deformities.
The polio vaccine is offered as part of the NHS routine childhood immunisation programme.
It's given in 5 separate doses:
- at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age – as part of the 6-in-1 (DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB) vaccine

In cases where an obvious situational factor is responsible for the insomnia, correcting or removing the cause generally cures the problem. For example, if insomnia is related to a transient stressful situation, such as jet lag or an upcoming examination, it will then be cured when the situation resolves. Generally speaking, the treatment of insomnia can be divided into non-medical or behavioral approaches and medical therapy. Both approaches are necessary to successfully treat the problem, and combinations of these approaches may be more effective than either approach alone. When it's related to a known medical or psychiatric condition, then appropriate treatment of that problem is in the forefront of therapy for insomnia in addition to the specific therapy for insomnia itself. Without adequately addressing the underlying cause, insomnia will likely go on despite taking aggressive measures to treat it with both medical and non-medical therapies."

 - Avoid air blowing in your eyes. Don't direct hair dryers, car heaters, air conditioners or fans toward your eyes.
 - Add moisture to the air. In winter, a humidifier can add moisture to dry indoor air.
 - Consider wearing wraparound sunglasses or other protective eyewear. Safety shields can be added to the tops and sides of eyeglasses to block wind and dry air.  - Ask about shields where you buy your eyeglasses.
 - Take eye breaks during long tasks.  - If you're reading or doing another task that requires visual concentration, take periodic eye breaks. Close your eyes for a few minutes. Or blink repeatedly for a few seconds to help spread your tears evenly over your eyes.
 - Be aware of your environment. The air at high altitudes, in desert areas and in airplanes can be extremely dry. When spending time in such an environment, it may be helpful to frequently close your eyes for a few minutes at a time to minimize evaporation of your tears.
 - Position your computer screen below eye level. If your computer screen is above eye level, you'll open your eyes wider to view the screen. Position your computer screen below eye level so that you won't open your eyes as wide. This may help slow the evaporation of your tears between eye blinks.
 - Stop smoking and avoid smoke. If you smoke, ask your doctor for help devising a quit-smoking strategy that's most likely to work for you. If you don't smoke, stay away from people who do. Smoke can worsen dry eyes symptoms.
 - Use artificial tears regularly. If you have chronic dry eyes, use eyedrops even when your eyes feel fine to keep them well lubricated."

More research is needed, but it might be beneficial to do the following:
 - Keep your mind active. Mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, solving puzzles and playing word games, and memory training might delay the onset of dementia and decrease its effects.
 - Be physically and socially active. Physical activity and social interaction might delay the onset of dementia and reduce its symptoms. Aim for 150 minutes of exercise a week.
 - Quit smoking. Some studies have shown that smoking in middle age and beyond might increase your risk of dementia and blood vessel conditions. Quitting smoking might reduce your risk and will improve your health.
 - Get enough vitamins. Some research suggests that people with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. You can get vitamin D through certain foods, supplements and sun exposure. More study is needed before an increase in vitamin D intake is recommended for preventing dementia, but it's a good idea to make sure you get adequate vitamin D. Taking a daily B-complex vitamin and vitamin C also might help.
 - Manage cardiovascular risk factors. Treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Lose weight if you're overweight. High blood pressure might lead to a higher risk of some types of dementia. More research is needed to determine whether treating high blood pressure may reduce the risk of dementia.
 - Treat health conditions. See your doctor for treatment for depression or anxiety.
 - Maintain a healthy diet. A diet such as the Mediterranean diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in certain fish and nuts — might promote health and lower your risk of developing dementia. This type of diet also improves cardiovascular health, which may help lower dementia risk.
 - Get good-quality sleep. Practice good sleep hygiene, and talk to your doctor if you snore loudly or have periods where you stop breathing or gasp during sleep.
 - Treat hearing problems. People with hearing loss have a greater chance of developing cognitive decline. Early treatment of hearing loss, such as use of hearing aids, might help decrease the risk.

 - Wear protective clothing. When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.
 - Use mosquito repellent. Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it. For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of DEET.
 - Reduce mosquito habitat. The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing water that can collect in such things as used automobile tires. You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs. At least once a week, empty and clean containers that hold standing water, such as planting containers, animal dishes and flower vases. Keep standing water containers covered between cleanings.

 - Wash your hands. Wash your hands after preparing or eating food, using the bathroom, or changing diapers. Make sure that children also wash their hands before eating, after using the bathroom and after contact with animals.
Risky foods :
 - Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F (71 C). Hamburgers should be well-done, with no pink showing. But color isn't a good guide to know if the meat is done cooking. Meat — especially if grilled — can brown before it's completely cooked. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that meat is heated to at least 160 F (71 C) at its thickest point.
 - Drink pasteurized milk, juice and cider. Any boxed or bottled juice kept at room temperature is likely to be pasteurized, even if the label doesn't say so. Avoid any unpasteurized dairy products or juice.
 - Wash raw produce thoroughly. Washing produce may not get rid of all E. coli — especially in leafy greens, which provide many places for the bacteria to attach themselves to. Careful rinsing can remove dirt and reduce the amount of bacteria that may be clinging to the produce.

Medications can be also be used to decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart and to allow the heart muscle to function more efficiently. Aspirin may be recommended to make platelets less sticky to prevent clot formation and prevent heart attack. Long-acting nitroglycerin medications (Imdur, Nitropaste) may be prescribed to dilate coronary arteries and increase blood flow to the heart muscle. As well, nitroglycerin may be used to abort an episode of angina. In this case it may be taken as a tablet or spray under the tongue. The best treatment for angina is prevention, especially if the cause is ASHD. Lifelong control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes will help prevent the development of plaque buildup within arteries not only in the heart but also the brain and peripheral arteries as well.

 - Limit time you're outdoors in cold, wet or windy weather. Pay attention to weather forecasts and wind chill readings. In very cold, windy weather, exposed skin can develop frostbite in a matter of minutes.
 - Dress in several layers of loose, warm clothing. Air trapped between the layers of clothing acts as insulation against the cold. Wear windproof and waterproof outer garments to protect against wind, snow and rain.
 - Wear a hat or headband that fully covers your ears. Heavy woolen or windproof materials make the best headwear for cold protection.
 - Wear mittens rather than gloves. Mittens provide better protection. Or try a thin pair of glove liners made of a wicking material (such as polypropylene) under a pair of heavier gloves or mittens.
 - Wear socks and sock liners that fit well, wick moisture and provide insulation. You might also try hand and foot warmers. Be sure the foot warmers don't make your boots too tight, restricting blood flow.
 - Watch for signs of frostbite. Early signs of frostbite include red or pale skin, prickling, and numbness. Seek warm shelter if you notice signs of frostbite.
Seek medical attention for frostbite if you experience:
 - Signs and symptoms of superficial or deep frostbite
 - Increased pain, swelling, redness or discharge in the area that was frostbitten

But over-the-counter medicines called antifungals can usually clear it up in a few weeks. They’re available in creams, powders, and sprays.Reduce your risk of jock itch by taking these steps:

Stay dry. Keep your groin area dry. Dry your genital area and inner thighs thoroughly with a clean towel after showering or exercising. Dry your feet last to avoid spreading athlete's foot fungus to the groin area.
Wear clean clothes. Change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot. It helps to wear underwear made of cotton or other fabric that breathes and keeps the skin drier. Wash workout clothes after each use.
Find the correct fit. Make sure your clothes fit correctly, especially underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms. Avoid tight-fitting clothes, which can rub and chafe your skin and put you at increased risk of jock itch. Try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs.
Don't share personal items. Don't let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items. Don't borrow such items from others.
Treat or prevent athlete's foot. Control any athlete's foot infection to prevent its spread to the groin. If you spend time in moist public areas, such as a gym shower, wearing sandals will help prevent athlete's foot."

 - Care for your diabetes. If you have diabetes, make sure you examine your hands and feet daily for cuts, sores, and signs of infection, such as redness, swelling or drainage. Ask your doctor to examine your hands and feet at least once a year, and try to maintain control over your blood sugar levels.
 - Lose weight. Excess pounds not only put you at risk of diabetes but also place pressure on your arteries, constricting blood flow and putting you at risk of infection and slow wound healing.
 - Don't use tobacco. The chronic use of tobacco products can damage your blood vessels.
 - Help prevent infections. Wash any open wounds with a mild soap and water and try to keep them clean and dry until they heal.
 - Watch out when the temperature drops. Frostbitten skin can lead to gangrene because frostbite reduces blood circulation in an affected area.
Gangrene is a serious condition and needs emergency treatment. Call your doctor right away if you have persistent, unexplained pain in any area of your body along with one or more of the following signs and symptoms:"

If you have risk factors that increase your chance of developing periodontitis — such as having dry mouth, taking certain medications or smoking — you may need professional cleaning more often.
 - Good health practices. Practices such as healthy eating and managing blood sugar if you have diabetes also are important to maintain gum health.

 - Know your family's eye health history. Glaucoma tends to run in families. If you're at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening.
 - Exercise safely. Regular, moderate exercise may help prevent glaucoma by reducing eye pressure. Talk with your doctor about an appropriate exercise program.
 - Wear eye protection. Serious eye injuries can lead to glaucoma. Wear eye protection when using power tools or playing high-speed racket sports in enclosed courts.
Promptly go to an emergency room or an eye doctor's (ophthalmologist's) office if you experience some of the symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma, such as severe headache, eye pain and blurred vision."

 - Close the food buffet. Wash dishes promptly, clean counters and floors, and store your food — including pet food — in rodent-proof containers. Use tightfitting lids on garbage cans.
 - Reduce nesting material. Clear brush, grass and junk away from the building's foundation.
 - Set traps. Spring-loaded traps should be set along baseboards. Exercise caution while using poison-bait traps, as the poison also can harm people and pets.

To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids, follow these tips:
 - Eat high-fiber foods. Eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Doing so softens the stool and increases its bulk, which will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids. Add fiber to your diet slowly to avoid problems with gas.
 - Drink plenty of fluids. Drink six to eight glasses of water and other liquids (not alcohol) each day to help keep stools soft.
 - Consider fiber supplements. Most people don't get enough of the recommended amount of fiber — 20 to 30 grams a day — in their diet.
 - Don't strain. Straining and holding your breath when trying to pass a stool creates greater pressure in the veins in the lower rectum.
 - Go as soon as you feel the urge. If you wait to pass a bowel movement and the urge goes away, your stool could dry out and be harder to pass.
 - Exercise. Stay active to help prevent constipation and to reduce pressure on veins, which can occur with long periods of standing or sitting.
If you have bleeding during bowel movements or you have hemorrhoids that don't improve after a week of home care, talk to your doctor."
